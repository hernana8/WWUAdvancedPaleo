(1) Your identifications (how many species do you recognize in the group, and which specimens belong to which species). Explain how and why you came to this conclusion.

(2) The morphological features you used to distinguish each species, including whatever combination of qualitative or quantitative traits you think are important.

(3) The nature of ontogenetic change, if any, in the species. Explain your reasoning.

(4) The possibility of sexual dimorphism as a cause of morphological differences and how you evaluated that possibility.

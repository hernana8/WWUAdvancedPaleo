## Problem Set 1

**(1) How many genera are in the Miocene, Early Jurassic, Late Cretaceous, and Pennsylvanian epochs (not total, but in each epoch)? What code did you use to find out?**

`apply(PresencePBDB,1,sum)` 

There are Miocene-653, Early Jurassic-177, Late Cretaceous-396, and Pennsylvanian-121.

**(2) How many geologic epochs are included in this dataset? What code did you use to find out?**

`nrow(PresencePBDB)`

29

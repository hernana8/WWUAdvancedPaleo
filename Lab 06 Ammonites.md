`PART ONE`

**(1) Your identifications (how many species do you recognize in the group, and which specimens belong to which species). Explain how and why you came to this conclusion.**

I first separated the ammonites by basic whorl shape. Many display a form of involute shell morphology. However, specimens 2, 4, 5, 6, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 22 seem to have dramatic inward curling respect to the rest. The presence of a keel (specimens 1, 4, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25), or extensive ribbing (specimen 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 18, 20, and 21) would further differentiate between species. Ceratitic sutures are seen in specimen 11 and 8, not sure whether the remainder have the same suture pattern.

I believe there are three to four different types of species, some possibly displaying a juvenile stage and others an adult stage. 

**(2) The morphological features you used to distinguish each species, including whatever combination of qualitative or quantitative traits you think are important.**

Again I used the extensive ribbing, the presenece of a keel, and the involute/evolute shell shape to distinguish species. Ribs are quite close together on some species relative to other ribbed species. 

**(3) The nature of ontogenetic change, if any, in the species. Explain your reasoning.**

I really don't see any difference other than size. One can argue that the ammonites that do contain dramatic ribbing are more pronounced in the adult species.

**(4) The possibility of sexual dimorphism as a cause of morphological differences and how you evaluated that possibility.**

Recognizing sexual dimorphism in ammonites is pretty difficult, especially when the body chamber is eroded down. When specimens are whole and reach adulthood, the shell and living chamber is larger in the female than the male. We see many size differences between similar species in our file. However, it is too difficult to destinguish dimoprhic pairs based on sight alone. 


`PART TWO`

**(1) Each element of the plethodon list has a name. What are they?**

Using `summary (plethodon)`, the list includes: land, links, species, site, and outline.

**(2) What class is each object?**

`class(plethodon["site"])` says list for each of the objects; e.g., "land", "species",...

**(3) Whare are the dimensions of the first object in the plethodon list?**

`lengths(plethodon)` yields 960 for the first object, "Lands".
 
    Subsection TWO
   
   **(1) Use the hummingbird dataset. Which object in the list records the landmark data?**
   
   "Land"

   **(4) How many "species" of hummingbird are there?**
   
   There is either one or five.

`PART THREE`

**(1) What is the synapomorphy of the clade containing species D and E?**
Fangs longer than 6".

**(2)What is a plesiomorphic character of that clade?**
Sulfurous odor.

**(3)What is the synapomorphy of the clade containing species A and B?**
Adorable eyelashes.

**(4)Which taxa have a sulfurous odor?**
C,D,E

**(5)What character distinguishes species D from species E?**
Laser Death Ray

**(6)Are adorable eyelashes a synapomorphy or an autapomorphy?**
Synapomorphy

**(7)Traditionally, the five taxa are grouped into three families. Determine if each family is monophyletic, paraphyletic, or polyphyletic.**
Fluffy tail is monophyletic, Adorable eyelashes is paraphyletic, and Sulfurous Odor is plyphyletic.

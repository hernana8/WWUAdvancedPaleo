(1) Your identifications (how many species do you recognize in the group, and which specimens belong to which species). Explain how and why you came to this conclusion.

I first separated the ammonites by basic whorl shape. Many, if not all, ammonites display a form of involute shell morphology. However, specimens 2, 4, 5, 6, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 22 seem to have dramatic inward curling respect to the rest. The presence of a keel (specimens 1, 4, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25), or extensive ribbing (specimen 1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 18, 20, and 21) would further differentiate between species. Ceratitic sutures are seen in specimen 11 and 8, not sure whether the remainder have the same suture pattern.

I believe there are three to four different types of species, some possibly displaying a juvenile stage and others an adult stage. 

(2) The morphological features you used to distinguish each species, including whatever combination of qualitative or quantitative traits you think are important.

Again I used the extensive ribbing, the presenece of a keel, and the involute/evolute shell shape to distinguish species. Ribs are quite close together on some species relative to other ribbed species. 

(3) The nature of ontogenetic change, if any, in the species. Explain your reasoning.

I really don't see any difference other than size.

(4) The possibility of sexual dimorphism as a cause of morphological differences and how you evaluated that possibility.

title: PROBLEM SET 2 (Intermediate)

**Section 1 Questions**

**(1)What does the replace = argument of the sample( ) function do?**


**(2)Using as(MyMatrix,"numeric") will not convert MyMatrix to a numeric data! Can you use another property of logicals other than as( ) that will convert the logicals of MyMatrix to 0's and 1's?**


**(3)If you wanted to check if all the elements in each row are true, how would you do this?** 


**Section 2 Questions**

**How many times does the number 7 occur in MyMatrix?**

**How do you find the sum of each column?**

**How do you find the product of each column?**

**How can you change every instance of the number 1 to 11?**

**How many values in MyMatrix are greater than 3 and less than 8?**

**How can you change the elements of column 12 into character data, while keeping columns 1-11 as numeric data?**

**Find which rows of MyMatrix have a sum >70. Make a new version of MyMatrix where the 13th column is a set of TRUE and FALSE values denoting which rows have a sum >70. (Hint: What type of object allows you to store both logical and numeric data at once?)**

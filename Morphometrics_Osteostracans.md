## **1. Examine the plot. What information does it visualize? Include your plot and answer to this question in your markdown file.**
![OsteoGPA Plot](https://github.com/hernana8/WWUAdvancedPaleo/blob/master/Rplot01.png)
The plot reveals all landmark data points (light gray) that were taken from each specimen. The darker circles represent the centroid or the average point for all related landmark points. Visually, we are able to deduce the amount of variation amongst data groupings.

## ** 2. Examine the information you have just generated (specifically, the PCA summary and the plot). What does this information tell you about the original set of Osteostracan skulls?**
The PCA summary, represented by principal component (PC1) through (PC19), are numbered by most variability to least variability. This allows us to see 19 of 26 PC's for our data set. PC1 variance is 56% of shape variance, decreasing as you move towards PC19; 0.002%. This means that PC1 has 56% shape variance in our specimen Osteostracan skulls.

## **3. The major axis on your plot shows the variance of principal component 1 (PC 1). According to the plot, which two specimens are LEAST similar in terms of PC 1? The two warp grids shown on the plot illustrate these two endpoints. Embed the .png files for these two specimens in your MarkDown file and describe the visual differences between them. What factor does PC 1 seem to describe?**

It appears that specimen 8 *Boraspis ceratops* and specimen 29 *Zychiaspis siemiradzkii* are polor opposites.

## **4. The minor axis on your plot shows the variance of PC 2. According to the plot, which two specimens are least similar in terms of PC 2? While you cannot see the warp grids for these two specimens on the plot, you can examine the .png files. Embed these images in your MarkDown file and describe the visual differences between them. What factor does PC 2 seem to describe?**


## **5. Examine the PC Summary. In the summary, you are given the standard deviation, proportion of variance, and cumulative proportion for each principal component. The proportion of variance tells you how much of the variance between specimens each principal component accounts for, and PC 1 always accounts for the most variance, PC 2 for the second most, PC 3 for the third most, etc. For most data sets, nearly all the variance can be accounted for by the first few principal components. For example, over 99% of the variance in this dataset is accounted for by PC 1-7.**


## **6. Create the barplot and embed the figure in your Markdown file.**


## **7. Try plotting PC 1 and PC 18. Include the code that you used in your MarkDown file, and embed the resuting plot. Why does it look like all the specimens fall almost perfectly along a single line parallel to the major axis?**

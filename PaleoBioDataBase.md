## Exercise Questions Part 2

**(1) Zoom in so that you can see from Texas to Florida and from Florida to New York. Some of the occurrences are orange and others are yellow. What is the significance of the different colors?**

`The different colors represent the geologic time or age these fossils come from (e.g.; yellow = Cenozioc; red = Permian).`

**(2)Zoom back out. Add an additioanl filter to the search bar, the Ypresian stage. The Ypresian is a time interval ranging from 47.8-56.0 million years ago. In what countries are there Ypresian occurrences of Abra?**

`Abra occurs in the southern United States, England, and Belgium.`

**(3)Clear the Abra and Ypresian filters from the search. Look for the genus Ambonychia (another genus of bivalve). Within the United States, find the city with the most occurrences of Ambonychia. What is the name of this city?**

`Cincinnati`

**(4) What age (Period) are most Ambonychia occurrences?**

`Ordovician`

**(5) During this time period, were most occurrences of Ambonychia arrayed parallel or perpendicular to the equator?**

`Perpendicular`

**(6) Click on the little insect icon on the left side of the screen. This brings up taxonomic information about the target taxon. What order does Ambonychia belong to?**
 
`Myalinida`

## Exercise Questions Part 3

**(1) All occurrences of Ambonychia in the Lexington Limestone as a JSON

**(2) All occurrences of mammals present in the Paleocene through Oligocene epochs as a csv

**(3) All opinions on the order Testudines in the Mesozoic

**(4) All collections of Aves, Marsupialia, and Sirenia in the United States as a csv

**(5) All occurrences of the gastropod genus Ficus as a csv

**(6) The next set of problems is free form, in that you can find the answers using any of the PBDB tools discussed so far.

**(7) What family does the genus Gastrocopta belong to?

**(8) There is only one occurrence of Isoetes in Portugal. What age is it?

**(9) What is the age of the oldest occurrence of Gastrocopta?

**(10) There is only one occurrence of Tiktaalik in the PBDB. Was that occurrence located in the tropics or the extratropics when that organism was alive?

**(11) There are two occurrences of Namacalathus in Siberia. What geologic formations are they found in?
